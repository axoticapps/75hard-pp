Privacy Policy — 75 Hard Social
Effective date: 14 February 2026

75 Hard Social (“the App”) is operated by Axotic Apps (“we”, “us”, “our”). This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

1) Information we collect

When you use the App, we may collect and store the following:

Account information

Email address (for login and account management)

Display name / full name 

Profile photo (if you upload one)

App data you create

Challenge progress and related app content you enter (e.g., tasks completed, logs, notes, timestamps, and other progress data you choose to store)

Friends and sharing

Friend relationships (who you add as a friend)

Your sharing preferences and permissions (what you allow friends to see)

Technical data (limited)

Basic device/app information needed to operate the service and troubleshoot issues (e.g., app version).


2) How we use your information

We use your information to:

Create and manage your account and authenticate you

Store and sync your app data across devices

Enable friend features and show shared data according to your permissions

Provide customer support and troubleshoot issues

Maintain the security and integrity of the App

3) How sharing works

The App includes social features. Your information may be visible to other users only when you choose to share it, such as:

Adding another user as a friend, and

Enabling sharing permissions for specific data (e.g., profile, progress, photos)

What you share (and with whom) depends on your in-app privacy/sharing settings. If you disable sharing or remove a friend, new access should stop, but previously shared content may remain visible in limited cases (for example, if it was cached on their device or included in historical views).

4) Where your data is stored (service providers)

We use Google Firebase to operate core features:

Firebase Authentication (login)

Cloud Firestore (storing app data and settings)

Firebase Storage (storing uploaded photos)

Firebase processes data on our behalf under its terms and security measures. We don’t sell your personal information.

5) When we share information

We may share your information only:

With other users, when you explicitly choose to share via friend permissions

With service providers (such as Firebase) to run the App

For legal reasons if required by law, regulation, or valid legal process

To protect safety and security, such as investigating abuse or preventing fraud

6) Data retention

We keep your information for as long as needed to provide the App, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. You can request deletion at any time (see Section 8).

7) Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your data, including using secure services and access controls. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we can’t guarantee absolute security.

8) Your choices and rights (access, sharing, deletion)

You can:

Update profile details and sharing permissions in the App (where available)

Remove friends to stop further sharing

Request account and data deletion

Deletion requests:
Email us at axoticapps@gmail.com from the email address associated with your account with the subject: “Delete my account”.
We may ask you to verify your request. Once processed, we will delete or anonymize your personal data and stored content where reasonably possible, except where we must retain certain information for legal or security reasons.

9) Children’s privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us and we’ll take steps to delete it.

10) International users

Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own (for example, where Firebase infrastructure is located). We take steps to ensure appropriate protections are in place.

11) Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If changes are significant, we’ll update the effective date and may provide additional notice in-app or via our listing.
